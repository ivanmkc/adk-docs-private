With Agent Development Kit (ADK), you can build complex multi-agent systems where different agents need to collaborate and interact using [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/)! This section provides a comprehensive guide to building powerful multi-agent systems where agents can communicate and collaborate securely and efficiently.

Navigate through the guides below to learn about ADK's A2A capabilities:

  **[Introduction to A2A](./intro.md)**

  Start here to learn the fundamentals of A2A by building a multi-agent system with a root agent, a local sub-agent, and a remote A2A agent. The following guides cover how do I expose your agent so that other agents can use it via the A2A protocol:

  *   **[A2A Quickstart (Exposing) for Python](./quickstart-exposing.md)**
  *   **[A2A Quickstart (Exposing) for Go](./quickstart-exposing-go.md)**

  These guides show you how to allow your agent to use another, remote agent using A2A protocol:
